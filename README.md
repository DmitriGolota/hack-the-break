## About Our Project:
Our Hack the Break project is focused on raising awareness about the Earth Ocean Ecosystem using a simple game. 🌊🌞

There are many important aspects about the Ocean that sustains our life on Earth 🌎, yet we have been mistreating and polluting our Oceans increasingly over the past few decades.

Using a simple game built using Python 🐍 and Pygame 🕹, we will take players on a journey with our friend, Namu, who is searching for home. 🐳 During the journey, players will be educated about exactly why we should care for the Ocean and pay attention to the life choices we make that affect it.

At the end of the game, we hope that our players will come out with some new facts that they have learned about the Ocean and how they can contribute to conserving this diverse ecosystem. ♻

Thank you for stopping by and checking out our project!
